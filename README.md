Demonstrates lifecycle management of stateful beans.
Performs basic operations such as adding, updating, and retrieving session-specific data.
Integration with Java EE containers like JBoss, WildFly, or GlassFish for EJB management.
Example business logic for managing shopping carts or user sessions.
